Create your own implementation of a modal window. Create an HTML
page with an action button Open Modal Window. After the user presses
it, a modal window appears. Please note! HTML of the window should be
auto-generated, NOT implemented into HTML. The window should have
an action button to close it. After closing, HTML should be deleted from
the DOM-tree.
* Add an option to create multiple modal windows, and delete them
after a certain window is closed.
* Create an animation with CSS when opening and closing modal
windows (they should appear and disappear smoothly).
